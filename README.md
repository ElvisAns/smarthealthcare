## Deployment

You can deploy this app on your local environment but you will not
exploit all of the features.
To fully test the ecosystem you need both the app and the device hardware

```bash
  -> git clone https://github.com/ElvisAns/smarthealthcare.git

```

To import the database make sure you created the database first then import sql (located within the repo) file
using your credential 

MySQL cli
```bash
  -> mysqlimport -h host -P 3306 -u user -p dbname pathto\patient_monitor final.sql

```
